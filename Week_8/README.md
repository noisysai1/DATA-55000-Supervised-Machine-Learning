# Week 08 ‚Äî Final IEEE Paper Submission: Crop Production Forecasting Using Supervised Machine Learning

## üìö Project Summary
This week marks the culmination of the **Crop Production Forecasting Project**, 
where the analysis from Weeks 6 and 7 was formally consolidated into an IEEE-style research paper titled **‚ÄúCrop Production in Agriculture.‚Äù**  
The paper evaluates 28 years of agricultural data to analyze how environmental and soil factors influence crop yield and productivity in India.  
Using **Supervised Machine Learning (SML)**, models such as **Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests,** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
were implemented to predict and classify crop.

## üß† Abstract
The study analyzes 28 years of agricultural data to assess the influence of **temperature, rainfall, pH levels, nutrients (N, P, K)**, and crop conditions on production outcomes.  
By implementing multiple **Supervised ML algorithms**, the project predicts crop productivity and helps improve decision-making for sustainable agriculture.  
Results highlight how data-driven insights support **resource optimization, crop management, and policy formulation** in India‚Äôs agricultural sector.

## üß© Methodology

### Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Size:** 99,849 rows √ó 13 columns  
- **Features:**
  - State_Name, Crop_Type, Crop  
  - Soil Nutrients: N, P, K  
  - Environmental Factors: pH, Rainfall, Temperature  
  - Output Variables: Area, Production, Yield per Hectare  

### Preprocessing Steps
1. Removed irrelevant columns: `State_Name`, `Crop`, `Crop_Type` for encoding.  
2. Encoded categorical labels using **LabelEncoder()**.  
3. Split dataset using an 80/20 **train-test split**.  
4. Scaled features using **StandardScaler()**.  
5. Evaluated multiple algorithms under identical preprocessing conditions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms Implemented

### 1. **Linear Regression**
- Predicts continuous outcomes such as **production (tons)** or **yield per hectare**.
- Captures direct relationships between soil/environmental parameters and crop output.
- Example: Predicting rice production from rainfall and pH values.

### 2. **Logistic Regression**
- Handles binary and multi-class classification problems.
- Used to predict **crop type** or **yield category (High, Medium, Low)**.  
- **Accuracy:** 87.26%  
- **F1-Score:** 0.85  
- Demonstrated strong generalization and interpretability:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

### 3. **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Built using `criterion="entropy"` for information gain-based splitting.  
- Perfectly fit the training data with **100% training accuracy**, but showed reduced generalization (~38% effective accuracy) due to overfitting.  
- Provided visual interpretability via decision paths:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

### 4. **Random Forest**
- Combined multiple trees to reduce overfitting and improve predictive accuracy.  
- Real-world use case: predicting customer churn or crop yield variability.
- Outperformed Decision Tree with higher stability across different folds.

### 5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Used for binary classification with margin optimization.
- Example: Distinguishing between **disease-resistant** and **susceptible** crop varieties.
- Produced reliable separation between crop categories based on soil and weather attributes.
